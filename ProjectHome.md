When completed this will be a game in which you guide a balloon up through a maze of dangers.  One control style will be clicking the mouse near the balloon.  The mouse click creates a radial force that pushes the balloon away.  You can use this technique to keep the balloon from touching anything dangerous.  The other control style I would like to implement is to use the motion sensor on a macbook or macbook pro.  By turning the computer you move the entire game board thus allowing the balloon to float up and escape.

Maps are editable with any text editor.

Currently the "look" of the game hasn't been created.  I am using tiles and images that are borrowed from the gosu example code.
